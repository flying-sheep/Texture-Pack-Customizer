About
=====
Since many people customized their terrain.png for my favourite texture pack,
“JohnSmith’s”, i figured that it’s time for a tool to make this more pleasant.

My choice was a HTML5+JavaScript webapp, because i wanted to try some of the new
stuff and it can be used without downloading.

Additional stuff
================
*	`serve.sh` creates a small python webserver and starts firefox, since some
	security policies prevent firefox from cd-ing to data:uris. \*shrug\*

Used projects
=============
*	JSZip_
*	JCanvas_ (David Duponchel’s branch_)
*	Canvas2Image_
